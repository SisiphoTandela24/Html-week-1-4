The web(World Wide Web), is an interconnected system of documents and resources that are accessed via the internet. Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
Web has been a fundamental aspect of modern life since it was invented. The web relies on technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create and display content in web browsers. Websites are hosted on web servers and can be accessed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). The web encompasses a wide range of content, including static web pages, dynamic web applications, multimedia, and more. It has transformed communication, commerce, education, and entertainment on a global scale.

ARIA roles(Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles
Aria roles are a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility for users with disabilities. They help assistive technologies, such as screen readers, understand the purpose and structure of web content more accurately. ARIA roles include landmarks (e.g., navigation, main content, search), widgets (e.g., button, checkbox, slider), and more. By using ARIA roles appropriately, developers can make their web applications more accessible and usable for everyone.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, using elements and tags to define various parts such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.
