The web(World Wide Web), is an interconnected system of documents and resources that are accessed via the internet. Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
Web has been a fundamental aspect of modern life since it was invented. The web relies on technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create and display content in web browsers. Websites are hosted on web servers and can be accessed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). The web encompasses a wide range of content, including static web pages, dynamic web applications, multimedia, and more. It has transformed communication, commerce, education, and entertainment on a global scale.

ARIA roles(Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles
Aria roles are a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility for users with disabilities. They help assistive technologies, such as screen readers, understand the purpose and structure of web content more accurately. ARIA roles include landmarks (e.g., navigation, main content, search), widgets (e.g., button, checkbox, slider), and more. By using ARIA roles appropriately, developers can make their web applications more accessible and usable for everyone.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, using elements and tags to define various parts such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

HTML Basics

1.Tags
HTML uses tags to define elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, like `<tagname>`. They usually come in pairs, with an opening tag `<tagname>` and a closing tag `</tagname>`. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph, and `</p>` is the closing tag.

2.Attributes
HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are placed within the opening tag and usually come in name-value pairs, like `attribute="value"`. For example, `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">` has two attributes: `src` and `alt`.

3.Structure
An HTML document typically consists of several main sections, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML. The `<html>` element wraps the entire HTML document. The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets. The `<body>` element contains the content visible to users.

4.Text Formatting
HTML provides tags for text formatting, such as headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), bold (`<strong>` or `<b>`), italic (`<em>` or `<i>`), and more.

5.Links and Images
HTML allows you to create hyperlinks using the `<a>` element and insert images using the `<img>` element. Links are created by specifying the URL in the `href` attribute of the `<a>` element, and images are inserted by specifying the image source (`src`) in the `<img>` element.

6.Lists
HTML supports ordered lists (`<ol>`), unordered lists (`<ul>`), and list items (`<li>`). Ordered lists display items in a numbered sequence, while unordered lists display items with bullet points.

HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. Each element is represented by a pair of tags, an opening tag, and a closing tag, with content in between. Some common HTML elements include:

1. `<html>`: Defines the root of an HTML document.
2. `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as title, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
3. `<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document.
4. `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document that is visible to users.
5. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.: Heading elements used to define headings of different levels.
6. `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
7. `<a>`: Creates a hyperlink.
8. `<img>`: Inserts an image.
9. `<div>`: Defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
10. `<span> Defines a section in an HTML document for styling purposes.
